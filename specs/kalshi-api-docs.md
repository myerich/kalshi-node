- [Get Market](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-market.md):  Endpoint for getting data about a specific market by its ticker. A market represents a specific binary outcome within an event that users can trade on (e.g., "Will candidate X win?"). Markets have yes/no positions, current prices, volume, and settlement rules.

The order book shows all active bid orders for both yes and no sides of a binary market. It returns yes bids and no bids only (no asks are returned). This is because in binary markets, a bid for yes at price X is equivalent to an ask for no at price (100-X). For example, a yes bid at 7¢ is the same as a no ask at 93¢, with identical contract sizes.  Each side shows price levels with their corresponding quantities and order counts, organized from best to worst prices.

- [Get Series List](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-series-list.md):  Endpoint for getting data about multiple series with specified filters.  A series represents a template for recurring events that follow the same format and rules (e.g., "Monthly Jobs Report", "Weekly Initial Jobless Claims", "Daily Weather in NYC"). This endpoint allows you to browse and discover available series templates by category.

A trade represents a completed transaction between two users on a specific market. Each trade includes the market ticker, price, quantity, and timestamp information. This endpoint returns a paginated response. Use the 'limit' parameter to control page size (1-1000, defaults to 100). The response includes a 'cursor' field - pass this value in the 'cursor' parameter of your next request to get the next page. An empty cursor indicates no more pages are available.

If CreateMarketInMultivariateEventCollection has never been hit with that variable combination before, this will return a 404.
- [Create Order Group](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/order-groups/create-order-group.md):  Creates a new order group with a contracts limit measured over a rolling 15-second window. When the limit is hit, all orders in the group are cancelled and no new orders can be placed until reset.

- [Trigger Order Group](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/order-groups/trigger-order-group.md):  Triggers the order group, canceling all orders in the group and preventing new orders until the group is reset.
- [Update Order Group Limit](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/order-groups/update-order-group-limit.md):  Updates the order group contracts limit (rolling 15-second window). If the updated limit would immediately trigger the group, all orders in the group are canceled and the group is triggered.
- [Amend Order](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/amend-order.md):  Endpoint for amending the max number of fillable contracts and/or price in an existing order. Max fillable contracts is `remaining_count` + `fill_count`.

- [Batch Create Orders](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/batch-create-orders.md):  Endpoint for submitting a batch of orders. Each order in the batch is counted against the total rate limit for order operations. Consequently, the size of the batch is capped by the current per-second rate-limit configuration applicable to the user. At the moment of writing, the limit is 20 orders per batch.
- [Cancel Order](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/cancel-order.md):  Endpoint for canceling orders. The value for the orderId should match the id field of the order you want to decrease. Commonly, DELETE-type endpoints return 204 status with no body content on success. But we can't completely delete the order, as it may be partially filled already. Instead, the DeleteOrder endpoint reduce the order completely, essentially zeroing the remaining resting contracts on it. The zeroed order is returned on the response payload as a form of validation for the client.
- [Create Order](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/create-order.md):  Endpoint for submitting orders in a market. Each user is limited to 200 000 open orders at a time.
- [Decrease Order](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/decrease-order.md):  Endpoint for decreasing the number of contracts in an existing order. This is the only kind of edit available on order quantity. Cancelling an order is equivalent to decreasing an order amount to zero.
- [Get Order](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/get-order.md):  Endpoint for getting a single order.
- [Get Order Queue Position](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/get-order-queue-position.md):  Endpoint for getting an order's queue position in the order book.

- [Get Queue Positions for Orders](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/orders/get-queue-positions-for-orders.md):  Endpoint for getting queue positions for all resting orders.
